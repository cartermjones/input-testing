# input-testing
Two input-testing scripts written in Python as a scripting exercise, one with and one without using regular expressions.

<b>input_tester.py</b> simply asks a user for their name, and then checks the name against a list of non-letter characters. If there's a non-letter in the name, the script will scold the user.

<b>regex_input_tester.py</b> achieves much the same thing, but through the use of regular expressions. 

While these scripts are not terribly useful in and of themselves, they do demonstrate the concept of testing input, and could be a starting place for password or username validation, if one wanted to code that from scratch rather than rely on validation that may be baked in to one framework or another. 

Quite frankly I just had fun writing them. Happy coding, everyone! :)
